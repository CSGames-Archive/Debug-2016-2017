# SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution

Language: Bash

## Description

SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution is the highly-reliable top of the art of modern security solution for professional-grade information systems.

Most commonly used security systems rely on algorithms that require some kind of personal secret (a password) to operate.

This clearly inefficient since the algorithms are well known by all foreign hackers and it is common knowledge that secrets are easy to guess for trained cyber criminals.

Moreover, if you forget your password, then you lose ALL your data.

### Why SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution?

SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution goes beyond the inefficient status-quo and provide 10 (ten!) encryption algorithms (instead of one). Even the NSA will not be able to decrypt your data!

But wait, there is more: there is no complex password with SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution. Nobody can guess your password if there is no password to guess! Even the FBI will not be able to decrypt your data!

But wait, there is more: once secured, there is no way to know something was hidden in the first place. Encrypted files look like a genuine file from another filetype. Even the GRC will not be able to decrypt your data!

But wait, there is more: the algorithms can be infinitely combined to form an inextricable layer-based security fortress. Even the KGB will not be able to decrypt your data!

But wait, there is more: there is no way for the evil forces to know the order of the algorithms since YOU decide them thanks to a simple PIN system. Even the ETS will not be able to decrypt your data!

## Usage

SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution takes two arguments. The first one is the input file to encode using the super secret encoding systems of SuperSecretSafeSystemSolution. The second one is the PIN encoded
algorithm serie to enode the inputfile with.

Possible pins are:

* `0`: Binary cloaked vaulting
* `1`: Mystifying mathematical encryption
* `2`: Impenetrable covered concealment
* `3`: Diabolically unbreakable cypher
* `4`: Futuristic low-level compression
* `5`: Literal secret hiding
* `6`: Invisible meta-information stenography
* `7`: Intricate colorful smuggling
* `8`: Shuffle internal binary encoding
* `9`: Unexpected international transliteration

	sssss.sh <inputfile> <pins>

See `src/sssss.sh` for more details on each encryption method.
