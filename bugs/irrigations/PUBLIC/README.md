# Banquet

As you may all know at this point, the Emperor is inviting every participant of the games to a marvelous banquet at the end of the competitions.

Though we do not want to bother with the placement of non-citizens, the table of the emperor must impeccable.

To make the event a success, it is primordial for the council to be placed in the right way.

We have a list of preferences for every council member, including the emperor himself.

We need the perfect disposition to maximize the happiness of everyone on the table.

We have a part of a final program which computes the maximum happiness level of the table.

It was initially written in Haskell, and has been rendered inoperable.

Can you fix it before the competitions are over.

You must not fail, the Emperor insists the table must be perfect.
